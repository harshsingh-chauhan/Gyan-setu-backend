/**
 * Database Configuration Module
 *
 * This file handles connecting to MongoDB using the Mongoose library.
 * Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library that makes it easier
 * to work with MongoDB in Node.js by providing schemas, validation, and
 * a simple API for database operations.
 *
 * @module config/database
 *
 * @example
 * // Import and use in your server startup
 * import { connectDB } from './config/database';
 *
 * async function startServer() {
 *   await connectDB();  // Connect to MongoDB first
 *   app.listen(3000);   // Then start the server
 * }
 */

import mongoose from 'mongoose';

/**
 * MongoDB connection string (URI).
 *
 * This tells Mongoose where to find your MongoDB database.
 * The URI format is: mongodb://[username:password@]host:port/database
 *
 * We read this from environment variables for security - you should never
 * hardcode database credentials in your source code. The fallback value
 * is only for local development.
 *
 * @constant {string}

/**
 * Connects to the MongoDB database.
 *
 * This function does three important things:
 * 1. Sets up event listeners to monitor the connection status
 * 2. Handles graceful shutdown when the app is terminated (SIGINT)
 * 3. Establishes the actual connection to MongoDB
 *
 * The function is async because connecting to a database is an I/O operation
 * that takes time - we need to wait for the connection before proceeding.
 *
 * @async
 * @function connectDB
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when connection is successful
 * @throws {Error} Exits the process if connection fails (can't run without database)
 *
 * @example
 * // In your server.ts
 * try {
 *   await connectDB();
 *   console.log('Database connected!');
 * } catch (error) {
 *   console.error('Failed to connect to database');
 * }
